# React-Uploady

React-Uploady is a lightweight library enabling React application developers to build file-upload features with just a few lines of code. ðŸš€

It does what it does best - provide the foundations needed to upload files from the browser, while leaving the UI (look & feel) up to the application.

The ðŸŽ¯ of this library is to be as simple as possible to use, yet customizable at every point. You can start small, or you can can configure just about every aspect of the upload flow. For this purpose, Uploady provides components, hooks, and plenty of features.
